<P>My primary resarch focus now is on interpreting gravitational-wave 
observations to learn more about massive binary evolution.  
Gravitational-wave observations allow us to probe the short, brilliant, 
turbulent, but somewhat secretive lives of massive stars.  Like a 
paleontologist who uses the skeletons of dinosaurs to discover what 
living dinosaurs looked like, we can begin to probe the evolutionary 
history of massive stars by observing their compact remnants, merging 
pairs of black holes.  My group is developing a dedicated code for <A 
HREF="http://compas.science"> Compact Object Mergers: 
Population Astrophysics Statistics </A> in order to model compact binary 
evolution and compare results to observations.  I recently wrote an

<!--I am interested in all aspects of the rapidly growing field of gravitational-wave 
astrophysics.  Gravitational waves that will be measured by ground-based and space-based 
detectors provide a unique way to explore the universe --- to observe in detail a variety 
of astrophysical and relativistic phenomena.  Gravitational waves (GWs) are an integral 
part of Einstein's theory of general relativity, and were one of the earliest predictions 
after its formulation.  There exists a significant body of indirect evidence for GWs, most 
famously in the observations of the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar, which loses orbital energy 
at a rate that matches the expected value from GW emission.  GWs have yet to be observed 
directly, however, making this a very exciting and challenging time in the development of 
the field of GW astronomy.

The first generation of ground-based interferometric GW detectors is already in operation.  
The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (<A 
HREF="http://www.ligo.caltech.edu">LIGO</A>) 
has finished a full year of data taking at the designed 
sensitivity.   In 2014-2015 Advanced LIGO detectors are expected to begin operating at 
sensitivities ~ 10-15 times greater than Initial LIGO.  These detectors will be able to 
detect GWs from inspirals, mergers, and ringdowns associated with coalescences of compact 
binary systems composed of neutron stars (NSs) or black holes (BHs).  Although estimates 
of the rates of such coalescences cover a rather wide range, Advanced LIGO may be able to 
detect tens to hundreds of these events per year.  A proposed space-based detector, the 
Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (<A HREF="http://www.lisa.nasa.gov">LISA</A>), will 
complement the 
ground-based detectors by being sensitive to waves at a lower frequency than ground-based 
detectors, with a peak sensitivity at a few mHz vs. ~ 150 Hz for LIGO.  LISA will thus be 
able to detect Galactic white-dwarf (WD) binaries, massive black-hole (MBH) binary 
inspirals, and inspirals of stellar-mass compact objects into MBHs.  In this era, when 
detections will become routine, GW astrophysics will be able to illuminate many of the 
mysteries of the most energetic phenomena in the universe.  However, to take full 
advantage of the wealth of information that will be available, it is incumbent to begin 
preparations for source analysis, data analysis, and astrophysical investigation today.
I am working in some of the following projects toward the goal of ensuring that we 
are adequately prepared to engage in GW astrophysics:

<UL>

<LI> <i>Rate predictions for compact-binary coalescences</i> I am finalizing a summary of 
the existing literature on compact-binary coalescences that could be detected by LIGO 
(these are coalescences involving neutron stars, stellar-mass black holes, and possibly 
intermediate-mass black holes). I am engaged in improving rate predictions for 
compact-binary coalescences and extrapolating them to elliptical galaxies.  Conversely, I 
would like to develop a framework for converting observed upper limits or rates for 
compact-binary sources into constraints on the complex multi-dimensional space of 
astrophysical parameters. <BR><BR>

<LI> <i>Parameter estimation for compact binaries</i>  We need to be able to accurately 
extract source parameters, such as masses and spins, in order to extract astrophysical 
information from observed GWs.  Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a particularly 
promising method for determining the parameters of a compact-binary coalescence signal.  
With colleagues from Northwestern University and elsewhere, we have implemented an MCMC 
search that allows us to estimate the maximum-likelihood parameters and to determine the 
parameter-estimation accuracy via the posterior probability-density function.  Current and 
planned work includes improving the sampling of the MCMC, comparing the 
parameter-estimation accuracy predicted by the MCMC with Fisher matrix results, and 
systematically studying (near-)degeneracies in the parameter space. <BR><BR>

<LI> <i>Intermediate-mass black holes</i> There is a growing, but still uncertain, body of 
evidence that a population of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) may exist in globular 
clusters.  If so, gravitational waves from intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (IMRIs) of 
stellar-mass compact objects into IMBHs could be detected by Advanced LIGO, and IMRIs of 
IMBHs into massive black holes in galactic centers could be detected by LISA.  I have 
worked on predicting the possible rates of such events.  Meanwhile, my current work on 
IMRI gravitational waveforms suggests that neither perturbative expansions in the mass 
ratio nor post-Newtonian expansions in the velocity will be faithful approximations of the 
true IMRI waveforms.  Further work is needed to develop hybrid waveforms usable for IMRI 
detection and to understand statistical and systematic errors in IMRI parameter 
estimation. <BR><BR>

<LI> <i>Online LISA data analysis</i> Some of the most exciting paybacks of LISA could 
come from simultaneous GW and electromagnetic observations of the same source.  In order 
to provide pointing information for telescopes, it will be necessary to perform rapid 
online searches on LISA data.  One possibility includes time-frequency approaches, which 
we have shown to work during Mock LISA Data Challenges.  I am continuing efforts to 
improve the quality of LISA data analysis via time-frequency spectrograms with an eye to 
applying them to online searches.  We will also consider other possibilities, such as 
searching for extreme-mass-ratio inspirals with simpler phenomenological waveforms. 
<BR><BR>

<LI> <i>Testing General Relativity</i> Because of the large number of cycles they spend in 
the strong-gravity regime, intermediate- and extreme-mass-ratio inspirals can serve as 
exquisite probes of the spacetime of the massive body involved.  For instance, they can be 
used to test whether the central body is a Kerr black hole by measuring higher-order mass 
multipole moments.  We had considered orbits in non-Kerr spacetimes to look for observable 
deviations from Kerr, such as the onset of chaos.  We will extend this work to inspirals 
driven by gravitational radiation. Future work will involve testing whether the 
differences in GW generation in alternative theories of gravity can be used to test 
GR. <BR><BR>
